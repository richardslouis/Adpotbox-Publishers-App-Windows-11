# Adpotbox (Richiesoft)
Adpotbox App [Win11 version]

# Overview

I wanted to share all my works for more than six years of Studio startup & personal project for public usage. I am the founder of Richiesoft Studio where I build enormous app covering consumer, media & ad verticals. This project is one of the repo I had personally stored.

A much simplistic tool which is used to manage ads with Richiesoft network. Adpotbox is a product of Richiesoft which manages and helps you to publish advertisements, with 0bc.xyz, Paperbooklet, Finiup, Glueping, Clothing, Archive codes and Magpoke/Eptro. Here, you can create the ad, manage them, make payments and ensure your ad is published. Also invoice can be downloaded using this app.We carefully choose you the product via which you can access the current digital media sector, and achieve a perfect campaign. Technology powered with really cool marketing helps in acheiving the best with the customers, and here we bring in the perfect blend of both.
